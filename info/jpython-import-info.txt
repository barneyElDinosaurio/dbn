You should be able to append to sys.path using the
PythonInterpreter.exec() method.

Sounds to me like your application jar is not on the
CLASSPATH when the app runs, or you are looking in the wrong
place for the cache.  Inside your app, use the interpreter
to print java.lang.System.getProperty('java.class.path') and
see what the result is.

How can you be sure they are coming from the jar file in
question?  If that jar file really isn't in the cache, then
it's unlikely.  If that jar file isn't even on the
java.class.path then maybe you're running from a directory
package without realising it?

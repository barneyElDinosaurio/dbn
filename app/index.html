(application only) it attempts to load the file             straight from the disk, either using a path relative             to the app, or an absolute path	 2. (applet only) relative to the document base --	    the same directory as html file	 3. (application only) as a 'resource', which would            be a file in the same directory as the classes,            just like codebase for an applet         4. (applet only) relative to the codebase --            i.e. dbn.jar or 'classes' folder         5. as an actual url (http://blahblahblah)         6. relative to root of same server as applet             (http://dbn.media.mit.edu/whatever.dbn)inline_program: put an entire dbn program directly                into the html to have it automatically load                use semicolons for newlines                it will be auto-beautified after loadingbg_color: # and six hex digits (web style! whoopee!)           that determine the foreground used by the appletbg_color_stipple: an alternating color, to get nice mixed colorstitle: small blurb of text that appears just below the actual       active drawing area. only visible in editing modetext_color: color of the title text that goes below the             100x100 drawing spacelanguage: one of the ISO language codes, for example:          en - english, ja - japanese, fr - french,          es - spanish, de - germanencoding: a text encoding converter, java style          look up String in java class libraries vol. 1, 2nd edition          examples include 8859_1 (standard) 	  and SJIS (japanese, shift-jis)display_mode: plain, flush, flush_more, and auto              these are undocumentedie: this seems to be a parameter to signal whether the applet    was being run inside of internet exploiter. i think it's     deprecated.--><applet codebase="classes" code="DbnApplet.class" width=600 height=350><param name="display_mode" value="auto"><param name="run_mode" value="immediate"><param name="bg_color" value="#336699"><param name="text_color" value="#ffffff"><param name="program0" value="test1.dbn"><param name="program1" value="test1.dbn"><param name="program2" value="test1.dbn"><param name="program3" value="test2.dbn"><param name="program4" value="test3.dbn"><param name="title" value="this is my stuff"></applet></BODY></HTML>

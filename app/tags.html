This is the documentation for all the PARAM tags used
by the DBN applet.

(last updated 8.9.99 by ben fry)

todo: put this in a real table and describe the defaults for each
</FONT>

<PRE>

run_mode: mouse_inside - runs whenever mouse is inside area
          edit - default, shows text area
          immediate - runs as soon as the applet is loaded

program: whatever.dbn, attempts to load from:
         1. (application only) it attempts to load the file 
            straight from the disk, either using a path relative 
            to the app, or an absolute path
	 2. (applet only) relative to the document base --
	    the same directory as html file
	 3. (application only) as a 'resource', which would
            be a file in the same directory as the classes,
            just like codebase for an applet
         4. (applet only) relative to the codebase --
            i.e. dbn.jar or 'classes' folder
         5. as an actual url (http://blahblahblah)
         6. relative to root of same server as applet 
            (http://dbn.media.mit.edu/whatever.dbn)

inline_program: put an entire dbn program directly
                into the html to have it automatically load
                use semicolons for newlines
                it will be auto-beautified after loading

bg_color: # and six hex digits (web style! whoopee!) 
          that determine the foreground used by the applet

bg_color_stipple: an alternating color, to get nice mixed colors

title: small blurb of text that appears just below the actual
       active drawing area. only visible in editing mode

text_color: color of the title text that goes below the 
            100x100 drawing space

language: one of the ISO language codes, for example:
          en - english, ja - japanese, fr - french,
          es - spanish, de - german

encoding: a text encoding converter, java style
          look up String in java class libraries vol. 1, 2nd edition
          examples include 8859_1 (standard) 
	  and SJIS (japanese, shift-jis)

display_mode: plain, flush, flush_more, and auto
              these are undocumented

ie: this seems to be a parameter to signal whether the applet
    was being run inside of internet exploiter. i think it's 
    deprecated.

PRIORITY:

// TODO set <net 1> 40 is broken

// TODO if error on last (empty) line, highlight it somehow
//      make empty lines highlight anyway 
//      (add a space? highlight to end of \n?)


LOWER PRIORITY:

// TODO finish dbn japanese and others

// TODO font size of text area (too small?? too big?)

// TODO can a NullPointerException be caught such that it would allow
//      dbn to continue running, even if there was an internal error?

// TODO if a mini-applet has a bug, set status bar on rollover (hard)

// TODO font size too big to get entire error msg
//      make sure all messages are short

// TODO need adjustable auto-slowdown (not ai-refresh)

// TODO better method of highlighting errors - color, flash, ?

// TODO need to internationalize // type program here
//      as well as breaking out warnings/messages/errors to separate file

// TODO would be nice to have auto-bug-reporting built into applet


FINISHED

// DONE make sense of all the vars madness

// DONE preprocessor must remove comments and 
//      (replace them with a blank line if they're on a sep line)

// DONE if variable not found, warn as such ...
//      (line said 4 vars needed after block)

// DONE repeat statement, then blank line, then brace is ok

// DONE take out 'found local var for repeat'

// DONE (-x) doesn't work. shit. also (-mx/5+50)

// DONE (-(x)) for math breaks things

// DONE findFunction not working inside math

// DONE need to add 'order of operations' to math commands
//      unless all math is assumed to move left to right (yuck)
//      can cheat on this by putting parens around * and / expressions
//      make an array of ints that have the math, another array with the ops
//      multiply first, then divide, then etc.
//      condense the array first with multiplies, moving left to right

// DONE  the following just stops w/o any complaints:
//      }
// 
//      paper 50

// DONE save should respond by message in the UI
//      do this by having a delay of at least 500 ms or so

// DONE add pause command again

// DONE add antialias command again

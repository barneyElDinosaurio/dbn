<h1>Introduction
<p1>Select an appropriate Paper.
<m1>
<p1>Select an appropriate Paper and Pen.
<m1>
<p1>Choose a Paper, Pen, and now draw a vertical Line.
<m1>
<p1>Draw a horizontal line.
<m1>
<p1>Draw a horizontal line together with a vertical line.
<m1>
<p1>Draw a triangle.
<m1>
<h2>A Few More Lines
<p2>Draw a square.
<m2>
<p2>Draw a rectangle dear to your heart.
<m2>
<p2>Create a representational image using no more than 20 lines.
<m2>
<p2>Draw a filled rectangle.
<m2>
<h3>Enough Lines to last a Lifetime
<p3>Create a general horizontal line.
<m3>
<p3>Create two jointed lines.
<m3>
<p3>Place the general line in Repeat.
<m3>
<p3>Create a gradated rectangle.
<m3>
<p3>Create two filled rectangles with two Repeats.
<m3>
<p3>Create two filled rectangles with one Repeat.
<m3>
<p3>Insert a Paper each cycle of the Repeat.
<m3>
<h4>The Dot Model
<p4>Set the dot in the exact middle to black.
<m4>
<p4>Set the adjacent dot to some value of gray.
<m4>
<p4>Create a small 5 by 5 image using just dots.
<m4>
<p4>Set a dot in repeat.
<m4>
<p4>Use multiplication to modulate dot placement in a horizontal line.
<m4>
<p4>Create a dotted diagonal line by modulating the vertical as well.
<m4>
<p4>Add a new Paper to each cycle of dotted diagonal line of 4F.
<m4>
<h5>Things That Fly and Fade
<p5>Create 2 flying dots that fly horizontally at the same speed.
<m5>
<p5>Make 1 dot fly faster than the other.
<m5>
<p5>Create 2 flying lines that fly vertically at different speeds.
<m5>
<p5>Create 2 flying lines that fly vertically in opposite directions.
<m5>
<p5>Draw 2 lines atop a fading background.
<m5>
<p5>Draw 2 fading lines atop a static background.
<m5>
<p5>Draw 5 fading lines with different fading characteristics.
<m5>
<h6>Painting to Reaction
<p6>Place a dot corresponding to where the mouse is located, namely &lt mouse 1 &gt and &lt mouse 2 &gt. Do this Forever.
<m6>
<p6>Stop the pen from leaking by being aware of the mouse button &lt mouse 3 &gt.
<m6>
<p6>Fashion a more sophisticated paintbrush.
<m6>
<p6>Place a paper in each cycle of the Repeat to translate paint to reaction.
<m6>
<p6>Draw a triangle that moves in relation to the mouse.
<m6>
<p6>Create a reactive graphic where 4 lines emanating from the 4 corners connect to the mouse.
<m6>
<p6>Using &lt; mouse 3 &gt;, redesign the graphic of 6F to also react to the mouse by inverting the scheme of gray while the mouse is pressed.
<m6>
<h7>Time, Time, Time
<p7>Using &lt;time 3&gt; and &lt;time 4&gt;, move dots and/or lines around the screen.
<m7>
<p7>Create a simple, functional clock.
<m7>
<p7>Create a dynamic compositition that will change throughout the day. Remember modulation and contrast.
<m7>
<h8>Nested Loops
<p8>Use a nested loop to draw a 10 x 10 square using only the 'set' command.
<m8>
<p8>Use multiplication to spread your dots out and vary the dot intensities. Use temporary variables xl and xy for dot position.
<m8>
<p8>Add a second set of dots in your loop which use new variables x2 and y2.
<m8>
<p8>Connect your first and second set of dots with the line command.
<m8>
<p8>Bonus time!
<m8>
<h9>Everyone's talking about the &lt;net&gt
<p9>I will publish the coordinates of the mouse on my machine at <net 1> and <net 2>. Represent these changing values inside a 'forever'.
<m9>
<p9>Create an applet that publishes values (such as your mouse coordinates) for others on the network. Display everyone's numbers in some fashion.
<m9>
<p9>With the rest of the group, create a small piece that interacts with others on the network in a more sophisticated fashion than the previous problem.
<m9>

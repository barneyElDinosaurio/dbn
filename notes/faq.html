      <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Frequently 
        Asked Questions about DBN</font></b>

<BR> <BR> 

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#666666"><b>
      When I try running downloadable DBN on Windows, a command prompt
      window flashes on the screen then disappears. What's wrong?
      </b></font></p>	

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>
this is a very common problem (especially with windows 95 and 98),
but can be caused by two things.
<P>
solution #1
<P>
try running DBN in a command prompt window to see if that works. that
is, open up a command prompt, change to the dbn directory, and type
'dbn' to run it.
<P>
if that works, then you should try moving your dbn folder to the base of
your C:\ drive, and edit 'run.bat' by replacing 'c:\dbn\bin\jre'
where you see 'bin\jre'.
<P>
solution #2
<P>
is there a file called 'dbn.pro' in the 'lib' folder? if so, you might
have gotten an error like this:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><PRE>Error reading dbn.properties
java.io.FileNotFoundException: lib/dbn.properties
    at java.io.FileInputStream.&lt;init&gt;
    at DbnApplication.main&lt;DbnApplication.java:37&gt;</PRE></FONT>
<P>
try re-extracting dbn.zip using winzip, and make sure that the
option for "make MS-DOS (8.3) filenames" (or something like that) is
disabled. otherwise you might run into some other random trouble with
mis-named files (you'll notice there are a couple of .pro files in 
the lib directory.

I am a designer working on project XXXX and for YYYYY big design
firm. I'd like to use DBN for my next project, but it doesn't seem to
support a large enough drawing area, or printing of high quality
graphics. Why?
      </b></font></p>	

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>
DBN doesn't yet support high quality printing of this kind, though a
future version may. The current version was written as a teaching tool
rather than a tool for regular use.

Is there a manual or a complete reference for the DBN language? 
      </b></font></p>	

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>
we don't really have a listing for the complete syntax of the language. we
have some scrawled notes at http://dbn.media.mit.edu/info/commands.html,
but that is an incomplete list (and not a clear explanation of each
command).
<P>
we hope to post something like this someday on the web site, but time
constraints have prevented us from doing so. perhaps someone in the dbn
community will do this.

What type of math is DBN capable of?
      </b></font></p>	

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>
currently supported operators are + - / * and %. all math goes inside
parenthesis, and is entirely integer-based (not 'real's or floating point
values).

Where are the decimal places? Why does (80/100) equal zero instead of 0.8?
      </b></font></p>	

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>
dbn doesn't support decimal places, it's all integer math.

you can get around this by multiplying numbers to make them larger and
dividing back down, though it's not terribly pretty. you could rewrite
your function in a way that works--for instance, the line function
y = mx + b, where m is 0.8 could be written as y = (8*x)/10 + b.

What about making DBN open source?
      </b></font></p>	

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>
currently, there are no plans to make dbn 'open source'. we've discussed
it internally, and given it serious thought, but it's not currently a
priority. mostly, this is because dbn is intended as a language for
teaching computational design, as a opposed to a general-purpose language
for day-to-day work. if open-sourcing it would be likely to make it a
better teaching language, then it might be more likely that we'd pursue
it. it's an interesting idea, though, and we may do something with it in
the future.

Is there a way to save the picture to TIFF, GIF etc. format? Is

      </b></font></p>	

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>
we have tested features such as these, and have used them in some
seminars and workshops. we haven't yet decided whether or not to
release these features, or if we have the time to support them. it is
likely that some of these features will be made available in DBN 3.0, 
which may be released as 'use at your own risk/unsupported'.

How do I run DBN under Linux?
      </b></font></p>	

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>
you'll have to do this by hand, because we aren't yet supporting
linux for DBN. however, it does work with a little tweaking. Here are
some basic directions that we gave to someone using a redhat distro.
<P>
1. download the windows version to your linux box, unzip it
2. cd to the newly created 'dbn' directory
3. type 'java -cp lib/dbn.jar DbnApplication'
<P>
if you get a message like "bash: java:  command not found" then that
means that you need to get java. it can be downloaded from:
<A
HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/download-linux.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/download-linux.html</A><BR>
click the 'continue' link under 'redhat rpm shell script'
<P>
after that, follow the install instructions at 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/install-linux.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/install-linux.html</A>
<P>
after that, try typing 'java' and see if it works. if installation was
successful, you should get some usage info (instead of the command not
found). if that works, you should be able to run DBN using the steps
above.

Will learning DBN help me learn how to program in JAVA or C?
      </b></font></p>	

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>
No. Programming in JAVA or C is quite different from programming in
DBN. It will help introduce you to the basic ideas and concepts of
programming, which might help you become more engaged in learning JAVA
or C.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#666666"><b>
When I leaf through the book, I see all this math. I don't think I
could ever do this. Do you have a better way?
      </b></font></p>	

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>
If you leaf through the book you will learn nothing. If you leaf
through a book on drawing you will also learn nothing. The only way
you will learn is by actually typing in the programs and seeing them
work (and not work); the same way you would have to actually practice
drawing to learn how to draw. There is no "math" in DBN; there are
only drawing exercises which are posed in a non-hand-based type of
manner.

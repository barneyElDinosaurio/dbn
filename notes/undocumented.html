<A NAME="refresh"></A><B>flicker flicker</B> <P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">
when your dbn program is running, the interpreter uses
patented ai-refresh(tm) technology to guess when 
the dbn window should be updated. but like most AI, 
it isn't (and can't be) perfect. so the discriminating
programmer (the anal retentive designer), often finds
that their program is flickering way too much.
<P>
the solution is to put <B>norefresh</B> at the beginning
of your program, which will tell dbn not to update automatically.
it will instead wait until your program calls <B>refresh</B>
to show your changes in the drawing area.

      paper &lt;mouse 1&gt;
      pen  &lt;mouse 2&gt;
      line 30 30 &lt;mouse 1&gt; &lt;mouse 2&gt;
      refresh   // update the screen
   }

</PRE>



<A NAME="array"></A><B>arrays</B> <P> 

<FONT SIZE="-1">
dbn doesn't support arrays, which makes some programmers very sad. 
in a moment of weakness, the maintainer of dbn succumbed to these
whiners and added an extra connector, called <B>array</B>.
this array has 1000 elements, which you may get and set
to your heart's content.

</FONT>

<PRE>
    // a boring example to show syntax
    set &lt;array 1&gt; 30
    set &lt;array 2&gt; 80
    set &lt;array 1000&gt; 40
    paper &lt;array 1000&gt;
    // draw a line from 40, 40 to 30, 80
    line 40 40 &lt;array 1&gt; &lt;array 2&gt;


</PRE>



<A NAME="antialias"><B>antialias</B> <P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">
this function enables and disables smoooove lines, by
anti-aliasing them. sometimes this makes the lines look
ugly and thick, but in other cases it might make your program
look a little better. you be the judge.
</FONT>

<PRE>
    // turn anti-aliasing on
    antialias 100

    // turn anti-aliasing off
    antialias 0

    // this would also turn anti-aliasing on
    antialias 1
    // anything from 1 to 100 does the same thing


</PRE>



<A NAME="pause"><B>pause</B> <P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">
pause is the german word for 'recess' (pronounced pow-zuh).
</FONT>

<PRE>
   pause 5     // wait for 5 hundredths of a second
   pause 200   // wait for 2 seconds


</PRE>



<A NAME="modulo"><B>modulo this and that</B> <P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">
modulo, the % sign, is a math operator that gives
you the remainder of a division between two numbers.

</FONT>

<PRE>
   // sets a to the remainder of 11 divided by 2
   set a (11 % 2)  


</PRE>



<A NAME="linenumber"><B>the magical line number buffer</B> <P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">
after running a program, hold down the shift key while
dragging the mouse to and fro inside the dbn graphics area.
as you drag over each pixel, the dbn editor highlight the line 
that was last to draw that pixel. ooh ahh! useful in 
understanding how dbn programs work.

<B>how to put DBN applets on your own web page</B>

<BR> <BR> <BR>

1. Download a copy of DBN from dbn.media.mit.edu.

<P>

2. Copy the file <EM>dbn.jar</EM> from DBN's <EM>lib</EM> folder into
the same folder as your web page.

<P>

3. Save your DBN program to a file, for instance <EM>fancy.dbn</EM>
and put that in the same folder as your web page.

<P>

4. Add the following text to your web page's HTML, and replace
<EM>yourprogram.dbn</EM> with whatever you called your program in the
last step.

<P>

<PRE>
&lt;APPLET CODE="DbnApplet" ARCHIVE="dbn.jar" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=110&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME="mode" VALUE="grid"&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME="program0" VALUE="yourprogram.dbn"&gt;
&lt;/APPLET&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

5. Your web page should now include your DBN program. 

<BR> <BR> <BR>

<B>problems?</B>

<P>

You may not be able to run that web page from the disk, you'll
probably have to upload it to your web server and check it there to
see if it's working. This is because Java won't let DBN read files
from your computer's hard disk.

<P>

If you're having trouble, contact <CODE>dbn-feedback@media.mit.edu</CODE>
